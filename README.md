Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client is DriverPass. They wanted a system to give student drivers a new way to study and prepare for driver's tests. The system would be a website that lets students take pre-tests and sign up for appointments.

What did you do particularly well?

In this project, I did exceptionally well with the diagrams and explaining the requirements.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part of my work on these documents, I would add more technical aspects, like ideas for what code to use in the system.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Using the interview with DriverPass, I understood the user's needs and created use cases and diagrams.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Creating UML and Gantt diagrams helped me start the project. Then, I thought about the functional and non-functional requirements and created use cases based on them.
